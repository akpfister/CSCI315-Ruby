***For tests 1 and 2 (other tests are to help the student)

The tests must match up to the beginning of each round, then the rounds will be judged based on the program giving the correct output via the result of the swing function. At the end, the summary should match except for the names. If program is output to a file, vimdiff will work for the picture, so, they should also be in the correct positions.
